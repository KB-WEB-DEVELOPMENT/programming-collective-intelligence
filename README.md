SUMMARY:

Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, 
and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human
behavior in general--all from information that you and others collect every day.
Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site,
blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains:

1. Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media
2. Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset
3. Search engine features--crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm
4. Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one
5. Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features
6. Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made
7. Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models
8. Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites
9. Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in adataset
10. Evolving intelligence for problem solving--how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game

Solution set available.

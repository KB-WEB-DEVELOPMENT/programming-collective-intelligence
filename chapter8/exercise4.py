# EXERCISE 4: 
# --> Answer: using the definition of the Gaussian weight function (p.175), if ss(=sigma
# in the Gaussian probability distribution function) is too high, the range of weights between
# 0 and 1 is distributed over larger distances.
# If ss is too low, the opposite is true (i.e: the Gaussian probability curve "falls" faster)

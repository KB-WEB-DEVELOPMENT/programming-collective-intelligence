# EXERCISE 2: Referring to the matchmaker.csv file sample on p. 198,
# we can create a cost function as follows:
# costfunction = A+B+C+D
# where: A = abs(age1-age2), B += 1 for each man's hobby != woman's hobby , B=0 if same list of hobbies 
# C = 0 if home city 1 = home city 2, C = 1 if home city 1 != home city 2
# D = abs(number of children wished by the man - number of children wished by the woman)

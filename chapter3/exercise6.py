# EXERCISE 6 

# 1) Assuming the k centroids are spatially randomly distributed at the start and the number 
# of items remains constant for each experiment, the total distance must decrease as k grows for
# a large number x of iterations.
# I suspect the relationship between k and the total distance is not (inversely related) linear, but most likely closer to an
# (inversely related) exponential function.

#2) At some point (?), adding more k does not change the total distance significantly.
